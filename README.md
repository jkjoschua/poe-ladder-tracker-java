# Path of Exile Ladder Tracker [Java]

This ladder tracker is implemented in Java and it shows your current character rank in a ladder with some other usefull information. The best thing is that this tool is very userfiendly and you don't have to touch any source code at all. A small graphical user interface will guide you through the "setup" of your specific league and character. By the way, races work as well!
